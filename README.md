# Snitch_Program_1.0
Golden Snitch Program

This is a passion project program. It started out as an idea to create a 
real life golden snitch for those playing quidditch to be able to have
something to use.

Before we could get into the mechanical engineering side of the project
I wanted to make sure we could even simulate a possible version of the 
project.
